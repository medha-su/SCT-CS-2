🔐 Image Encryption & Decryption

This project demonstrates a simple **image encryption and decryption tool** built using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**.  
It allows users to securely encode images into an unreadable format and later decode them back to the original image.  

🚀 Features
- Upload and encrypt any image using a secret key.
- Decrypt images with the same key to retrieve the original.
- Fully client-side (no server required) – secure and fast.
- Minimal and responsive UI built with HTML & CSS.

🛠️ Tech Stack
- **HTML5** – structure  
- **CSS3** – styling  
- **JavaScript (ES6)** – logic for encryption & decryption
